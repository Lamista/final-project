#### Description:

Introduction

Reflect & Grow is an app designed to help users track their daily habits and also keep a personal journal. It's meant to encourage personal growth and self-awareness by helping users keep up with their habits and reflect on their daily life.

Key Features

- Habit Tracking:  Lets users set up and keep track of their daily habits.
- Daily Journal: A place for users to write about their day and thoughts.
- Progress Visualization:  Includes a graph showing the top 5 habits, a table for tracking streaks, and a calendar to see when journal entries were made.
- User-Friendly Interface: The app is easy to use, making habit tracking and journaling straightforward.

File Structure and Contents

- app.py: Main file for the Flask app, handling routing and control.
- something-service.py: Manages the logic for habits, journal entries, and user data.
- database.py: Contains all the SQL queries for data management.
- templates/: Holds the HTML templates for the app's pages.

Technology & Design Choices

- Python & Flask: Chosen for their ease of use in managing web requests and page rendering.
- SQLite: Used for its simplicity, perfect for handling user data and journal entries.
- Chart.js & Fullcalendar: Added for nice visual displays of habits and journal dates.
- Bootstrap: Used for its ready-to-use styling options, ensuring the app looks good and works well on all devices.

Challenges and Solutions

- User Authentication: Adapted from my learning in the CS50 course.
- Data Visualization: Learning to display data visually was tough, but I got through it with help from documentation and examples from others.

Conclusion and Future Work

Working on this project has been a great experience in developing a full-featured web app. In the future, I would like to add more features to the habit tracker, like setting different types of goals, reminders, and more ways to visualize progress.
